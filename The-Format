# The Format: Day Zero Events

Day Zero events are short. Our events run on time and are two hours end to end. Events are comprised of two core parts, technical briefings and breakout sessions. Events are held normally 4-6 weeks apart with specific conduct expectations.

Events are hosted on Zoom and limited to 100 participants. Attendees are either nominated by existing attendees or apply to attend.

## Welcome and Opening Remarks

A member of the Brale community typically emcees a Day Zero event and welcomes everyone with opening remarks. A special guest from our community may also join this portion. They begin punctually and keep things brief to transition focus immediately to technical briefings.

## Part 1 – Technical Briefings

Each Day Zero event has 3 technical briefings. Each technical briefing is done by the company (normally founder, inventor, or product manager) and is an actual demonstration of the technology. Presenters don't use slides. Instead they are encouraged to show live examples of their software. Technical briefings are recorded. Technical briefings are 10 minutes each and are presented to all attendees.

## Part 2 – Breakout Sessions

Small group discussions in groups of 10-20 people focused on topics chosen by the attendees. There is a moderator in each session to keep the discussion moving. We like to encourage friendly debate during these sessions and sometimes they can expand on industry as a whole. These sessions run about 50 minutes, then everyone will return to the main session for some closing announcements.

## Closing Remarks

Breakouts reconvene in the main virtual meeting for closing remarks, announcements, and goodbyes. Day Zero ends on-time in respect of everyone's time and schedules.
