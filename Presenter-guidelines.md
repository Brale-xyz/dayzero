# Day Zero Presenter Overview

Day Zero events are short. Our events run on time and are two hours end to end. Events are comprised of two core parts, technical demos and workshop sessions. Events are held normally 4-6 weeks apart with specific conduct expectations.

Events are hosted on Zoom and are free with 100+ people typially in attendace. Demos are open to everyone and recordings are shared after the event. Registration is required. Workshops are application only. Applications are sumbmitted as a component of the main registration form. Workshop participants are hand-selected. 

## Part 1 – Technical Briefings

Each Day Zero event has 3 technical demos. Each technical demo is done by the company (normally founder, inventor, or product manager) and is an actual demonstration of the technology. Presenters don't use slides. Instead they are encouraged to show live examples of their software. Technical demos are recorded. Technical demos are 10 minutes each and are presented to all attendees. After demos, the event will condlucde for Day Zero attendees who aren't participating in workshops. This will be ~ the 1 hour mark.

### What this means for you:

* One person (or two people) from your team will be presenting
* This person(s) will be given co-host access right before your briefing begins
  * Please make sure to have all your windows already pulled up and ready to go when it is your turn
* One person from your team will be the chat box moderator where they will answer the questions that come in from the attendees during your demo
* **No slides**. The best demos are the ones that are true technical demos and the ones that get rated poorly are those that share slides. This group really wants to see the tech and how things work
* Your briefing will be recorded and shared on YouTube. We'll reach out to you after the video is published for awareness and so you can use it for other purposes
*To ensure high quality and make sure you’re feeling comfortable, we dry-run every demo with every presenter at least 1 week prior to the actual event

## Part 2 – Workshops

Every Day Zero includes Workshops. Usually, but not always, Day Zero demos include workshop on the same topic. Workshops are small with groups of 10-20 hand-selected people. Workshops are run by a leader (usually the demo presenter) partnered with a moderator who keeps the discussion moving. We like to encourage deep conversation and friendly debate during these sessions and sometimes they can expand on the industry as a whole. These sessions run about 50 minutes, then all workshop participants will return to the main session for some closing announcements.

### What this means for you:

* You will lead the workshop partnered with a moderator who we agree on together.
* If the moderator is not someone you already know, we will introduce you to your moderator in advance of the event. We encourage you to find some time to connect for introductions and to discuss the workshop and your strategy together.
* You’ll be provided bio information for workshop participants at least 2 days prior to the event
* You’ll be connected to the participants via a group email at least 3 days prior to the event. You can use the email to share information, tools, resources ahead, and to get the conversation started with prompts and questions.
* If you are leading a workshop your team will be sent to that breakout session by the Brale Zoom administrators after demos. There will be 10-20 attendees. Your moderator will join you.
* You will receive a 2-minute warning in Zoom toward the end of the alloted workshop time. This is the sign to wrap things up. All workshop participants, including you and moderator, will be automatically returned to the main virtual event room for wrap up and goodbye.
