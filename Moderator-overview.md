# Day Zero Moderator Overview

A great moderator respectfully keeps the conversation flowing and gives everyone an opportunity to share their point of view. To have the most robust discussions possible here is how we'd suggest running a session and the norms to follow.

As soon as you're convinced the majority of attendees are in your session please announce yourself as the moderator and go over some housekeeping items.

## Housekeeping Items

* Day Zero breakout sessions are not off the record, but no additional recording or screenshots are permitted. Any member of the media attending must treat comments as off the record.
* Everyone participates in breakout sessions. These sessions have been kept to a smallish size so that they can be manageable. Try to keep your answer short and succinct, under 2 minutes.
* Select a way that you want attendees to get your attention as the moderator so they aren't talking over each other. A raised hand that is physical or digital is always an easy way to do this but everyone has their own style
* Remind people to focus on the discussion. Please put your cell down, close slack or other chat windows if you have them open and let's dive in.

## Running the Session

### Introductions

Once housekeeping is out of the way ask for a round of introductions. As the moderator, we suggest you go first to demonstrate how a short intro works. This should be no longer than 1 minute per person and if anyone goes on and on, please help them wrap it up and move it along. The introduction is the first step to encouraging discussion and including everyone.

### Discussion Format

After their introduction, ask each person to weigh in on a question germane to your topic. For example, I previously led a session on machine to machine commerce and the question I asked everyone to answer after their introduction was:

* "Do you think that API to API commerce will overtake human to business commerce in our lifetime?" (This will also be associated with a brief description of how I'm defining API to API commerce)

This will give you an opportunity to hear the diversity of opinions in the room. Listen carefully for trends and then start asking questions based on people's positions. Giving interesting opportunities to people to explain deeper thoughts on a particular subject can go a long way.

### Sample Questions

Have 3-5 canned questions ready ahead of time in case there is a lull in the discussion. If you are moderating the company sessions you can focus these on technology or go to market if you'd like. Here are some easy examples if they are relevant to the company/discussion:

* How do you explain open source to a bank built on COBAL?
* How do you differentiate between SAAS providers? Is differentiation reflected in valuation?
* In your marketing how do you thread the needle between using the term AI when it's ML?
  * Since everyone here is an industry expert to some degree, what should the requirement be to say you have AI in your product?

## Additional Guidelines

* If you're working through a company Q&A breakout, strongly encourage the conversation to flow to industry topics and even technical topics if you're comfortable. These absolutely do not need to be about founding stories
* Your sessions will have people of diverse backgrounds which is why the intros are important
* As the moderator all you've got to do is listen to who folks are and help them have a lively discussion
* Breakouts are 50 minutes which will fly by. A counter will let you know when time is up
* Note: The majority of attendees are male and this is something we'll need to work hard to balance out in the next one

## Issues and Support

If you run into any issues or have problems with an attendee please let (events@brale.xyz) know behind the scenes through Zoom chat or via email. Our team has the controls so if we need to deal with a weird situation or a problem they can manually remove people from the session.
