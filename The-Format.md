# The Format: Day Zero Events

Day Zero events are short. Our events run on time and are two hours end to end. Events are comprised of two core parts, technical demos and workshop sessions. Events are held normally 4-6 weeks apart with specific conduct expectations.

Events are hosted on Zoom and are free to attend. Demos are open to everyone and recordings are shared after the event. Registration is required. Workshops are application only. Applications are sumbmitted as a component of the main registration form. Workshop participants are hand-selected. 

## Welcome and Opening Remarks

A member of the Brale community typically emcees a Day Zero event and welcomes everyone with opening remarks. A special guest from our community may also join this portion. They begin punctually and keep things brief to transition focus immediately to technical demos.

## Part 1 – Technical Demos

Each Day Zero event has 3 technical demos. Each technical demo is done by the company (normally founder, inventor, or product manager) and is an actual demonstration of the technology. Presenters don't use slides. Instead they are encouraged to show live examples of their software. Technical demos are recorded. Technical demos are 10 minutes each and are presented to all attendees. After demos, the event will condlucde for Day Zero attendees who aren't participating in workshops. This will be ~ the 1 hour mark.

## Part 2 – Workshops

Small group workshops with groups of 10-20 hand-selected people. Workshops are run by a leader partnered with a moderator who keeps the discussion moving. We like to encourage deep conversation and friendly debate during these sessions and sometimes they can expand on the industry as a whole. These sessions run about 50 minutes, then all workshop participants will return to the main session for some closing announcements.

## Closing Remarks

Workshops reconvene in the main virtual meeting for closing remarks, announcements, and goodbyes. Day Zero ends on-time in respect of everyone's time and schedules.
